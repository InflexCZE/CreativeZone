# How to disable CreativeZone
In order to return the game back to vanilla state, navigate to your game installation and delete all mod files. CreativeZone doesn't modify vanilla game files so it is not necessary to reinstall the game or perform game integrity verification (Steam).

# FAQ
**Q:** Can I use CreativeZone patching framework to make my own EndZone mod? <br/>
**A:** Sure, the more mods the more fun for all of us! <br/>  CreativeZone is published under GPL license which permits you to re-use and re-distribute its parts but keep in mind that in such case you should play fair and open-source your project as well. Game modding and scripting is often gateway to programming world (needles to say very enjoyable) for many newby programmers so having sources and examples they can learn from is vital for healthy community. 

# Disclamer
CreativeZone can make the game unstable and/or crash.
Edited worlds may get corrupted after save and/or may not function properly when switched back to survival.
Loading CreativeZone to version of the game it is not released for is not advised. It is likely that it will not load and/or not function properly.

Under no circumstances shall the author(s) be held responsible or liable in any way for any claims, damages, losses, expenses, costs or liabilities whatsoever caused directly or indirectly by CreativeZone and/or derived software.
